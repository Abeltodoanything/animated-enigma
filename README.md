## üì¶ Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Python Version Requirement

This project is built specifically for **Python 3.11.x**.

> ‚ùó Using newer versions (e.g., Python 3.12 or later) may result in errors such as:
> ```
> _tkinter.TclError: Can't find a usable tk.tcl
> ```
> or similar issues due to `tkinter` not being properly configured in the newer Python distributions.

---

### ‚úÖ Check Your Version:

```bash
python --version
```
If you are not on Python 3.11, download and install it from the official site:

[Download Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/)

On Windows, make sure to check the box ‚ÄúAdd Python to PATH‚Äù during installation.

### 1. Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abeltodoanything/cqbv2.git 
```
Then navigate into the project directory:
```bash
cd cqbv2
```
### 2. (Optional but Recommended) Create a Virtual Environment

Using a virtual environment helps you avoid dependency conflicts.

On macOS/Linux:

```bash
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
On Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```
### 3. Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Application

You can now run the main script to launch the application.

On macOS/Linux:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
On Windows:
```bash
python main.py
```
üîÑ Running the App Inside the Virtual Environment
Note: If you chose to use a virtual environment, make sure it is activated every time you run the application.

‚úÖ To activate it:
macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
You‚Äôll know it‚Äôs active when you see (venv) at the beginning of your terminal prompt. If you don‚Äôt activate the venv, Python may use the wrong version or miss required packages.
